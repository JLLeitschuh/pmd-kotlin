======================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jlleitschuh/pmd-kotlin.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jlleitschuh/pmd-kotlin)

PMD static analysis module for Kotlin programming language.

## History

This is technically a "Fork" of the work done by [Poeschl](https://github.com/Poeschl) which is, itself, a for of the
original project [pmd-kotlin](https://github.com/jk1/pmd-kotlin) from [jk1](https://github.com/jk1).

This project hopes to expand upon their work to add PMD and CPD support to the Kotlin programming language.
